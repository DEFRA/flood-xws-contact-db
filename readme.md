## Getting started

Pre-requisites:
1. [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) v12 with plugins PostGIS and uuid-ossp
2. [ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html) GDAL 3.0.4


### Mac Users

The easiest way to use PG on a Mac is with [postgresapp](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html).

Choose PostgreSQL 12.8 / PostGIS 3.0.3.

Postgresapp also comes bundled with ogr2ogr meaning you don't have to install that separately.

You'll need [make them available on your $PATH](https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html). You can do this by adding to your `.profile` or by following the instructions in the link.

### Initialising the xws contact database

Once `PG`, `psql`, `PostGIS` and `ogr2ogr` are available we can [create our initial database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-createdatabase.html).

Do this using your db client or via `psql`:

`CREATE DATABASE xws_contact;`

Now we are ready to prepare the database.

First ensure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set.

Then, from the root of this project, execute the following commands.

1. Run the db migrations

`npx knex migrate:up`

2. Seed the db

`npx knex seed:run`

3. Import the Alert and Warning Target Areas.

`cd bin`

`./populatedb`


### One liner
`npx knex migrate:down && npx knex migrate:up && npx knex seed:run && cd bin && ./populatedb && cd ..`

### Other useful commands

[Knex](https://knexjs.org/) is used for db migrations.

Create a new migration file
`npx knex migrate:make <name>`

Create a new seed file
`npx knex seed:make seed_name`

To run the next migration that has not yet been run
`npx knex migrate:up`

To run the specified migration that has not yet been run
`npx knex migrate:up <name>`

Run all seed files
`npx knex seed:run`

To undo the last migration that was run
`npx knex migrate:down`

To undo the specified migration that was run
`npx knex migrate:down <name>`

### GOV.UK PaaS

E.g.

`$ cf marketplace -e postgres`
`$ cf create-service postgres tiny-unencrypted-12 xws-contact-db-sandbox`

## Getting started

***Creating Target Area insert SQL from shape files***

After cloning the repo or when the zip files in `area/flood-areas` containing the Flood Alert or Warning Areas are updated then the SQL files which insert the target areas need to be regenerated. The script `scripts/generate-area-data.sh` will need to be re-run from the repo root directory. The generated SQL files are too large to commit to Github and so are ignored by git.

The shape zip files come from:

* https://data.gov.uk/dataset/0d901c4a-6e1a-4f9a-9408-73e0c1f49dd3/flood-warning-areas
* https://data.gov.uk/dataset/7749e0a6-08fb-4ad8-8232-4e41da74a248/flood-alert-areas
